No idea what it could be so I tear open the package. Our dog was very interested btw. I get a smell like nuts so I’m thinking ‘strange she would send me nuts’ when a few fall out onto my shirtless torso and on the bed. They’re very black and now I’m more confused. Then I focus on one and I realize it’s a cricket body. She sent me fried crickets. One of the bags must have broken open in transit so they’re falling all over the place and my wife is losing her SHIT screaming about bugs in the bed.

For a while after she left we snapped often, mostly chatting and small talk. On more than one occasion she invited me to come over her house to hang out (she lived with her family still). Sometimes I had other prior commitments so I couldn't make it but other times I just felt too nervous about going over her house by myself that I made up excuses and stayed home. At one point she literally hit me with the ‘my parents aren't home’ bit and I completely brushed it off and claimed I had ‘something else to go to’. Anyway, we start approaching the start of school and I head back to college, but we still have been chatting in the time being.

She had been working there for about 2 years with me but it wasn't until this past summer we really started to make a connection. Most of our interactions while working or on break were always great and we seemed to have a certain sort of chemistry. Then in the latter half of summer she left that job to go somewhere more related to her field of study. Before she did however, she gave me her snap so we could keep in touch which we did. For a while after she left we snapped often, mostly chatting and small talk. On more than one occasion she invited me to come over her house to hang out (she lived with her family still). Sometimes I had other prior commitments so I couldn't make it but other times I just felt too nervous about going over her house by myself that I made up excuses and stayed home. At one point she literally hit me with the ‘my parents aren't home’ bit and I completely brushed it off and claimed I had ‘something else to go to’. Anyway, we start approaching the start of school and I head back to college, but we still have been chatting in the time being. Once the first week of classes hit however, she just stopped responding to my messages. I figured she was busy with classes but after a while (several weeks) of me sending the occasional snap or ‘hey’ with no response I realized she had most likely ghosted me.

That's alot of weight to get stopped quickly. My ankles were simply not hoss enough to handle it. My feet hit the ground and I thought I heard my boots scrape the ground, in hindsight I think it was my ankles. The area around my ankles went numb and tingly while simultaneously hurting like hell. I tumbled about 5 times hitting my elbow along the way leaving it nice and bruised. I layed out and all I could do was yell in pain. I had bilateral fractures in both of my ankles. Meaning I broke both bones in each ankle totalling out to four bones broke. According to the doc, that was the second worst type of fracture I could've gotten. I destroyed my left ankle joint with the doc pulling out a lot of bone and cartilage fragments. I'm non weight baring for 8-10 weeks.

It’s not until I’m almost out the door that I realize what I’m wearing. Keep in mind, these are not Depend that advertise how discreet they are under yoga pants. These are made for bedwetting. They’re geriatric, tape-on incredibly thick and high waisted diapers, and not to be gross but it was wet too which makes it thicker. The waistband was peeking above my pants and the bulk clearly showed through the thin fabric of my shorts. I tried to yank my tank top down as far as I could, but it still didn’t meet the waistband of my shorts. I thought if I didn’t draw attention to it, maybe no one would notice. That is until I heard a guy in a group of about 10 people behind me whisper “I think that chicks wearing a diaper” a couple of people did a light gasp and giggle and I heard one girl say “oh my god, not so loud, she must be so embarrassed.” I turned around instinctively at the group and one girl said to me “cute shorts” and a couple more of them giggled. I was beyond humiliated and turned bright red. That’s when my roommates both looked down and saw the mess that was my lower half. One of them went silent and her eyes went as wide as saucers. My other roommate took off her robe (she was also wearing pajamas) and handed it to me and said “here you look really cold.” I then put on the robe and waited what seemed like an eternity until they let us in the building. As I was walking upstairs I heard someone below us in that same group ask “so was that girl seriously wearing a diaper” and someone responded “yeah I think she was. This happened a couple days ago and no one has said anything to me sense, but I have never been so embarrassed in my life.\"\n  }]),\n      _useState10 = _slicedToArray(_useState9, 2),\n

Hadn’t seen them in awhile and they had never been to Texas (we are from California and they are originally from Thailand but we met in California years back). We showed them some of the unique things about Texas eg bbq, bucees, etc. Anyway while they were here we started talking about eating different things from different countries and she asks if I have ever eaten bugs. I have but only once but I’m open to try anything once. Fast forward to this morning. I’m laying in bed and my wife goes to get the mail. She hands me a padded envelope and says it’s from (friend). No idea what it could be so I tear open the package. Our dog was very interested btw. I get a smell like nuts so I’m thinking ‘strange she would send me nuts’ when a few fall out onto my shirtless torso and on the bed. They’re very black and now I’m more confused. Then I focus on one and I realize it’s a cricket body. She sent me fried crickets. One of the bags must have broken open in transit so they’re falling all over the place and my wife is losing her SHIT screaming about bugs in the bed. I am laughing hysterically picking cricket parts out of my chest hair while she runs away making a combination of screaming, laughing, and gagging sounds.\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Rude Coworkers\", \"trigger\": \"Fear\", \"day\": \"06-12-2021\", \"story\": \"Today was my first day back from 13 days of isolation.

She interrupted me to tell us how upset she is that so many people are out and how much extra work she has to do. I told her I had been out because sometimes people get sick and they need to take time off, and the mandates in our state require those who test positive to quarantine for 10 days. She then exclaimed, pointing her bony finger angrily at me, 'so, you're the damn superspreader!' I said to her 'no, I wasn't, but I heard that was your nickname in high school.'

I hate how long it takes dried beans to cook so I decided to presoak them in a canning jar. In my infinite wisdom I thought 'canned beans don't need to be refrigerated so these shouldn't be any different.' This morning I noticed there were bubbles coming out of the jar in my pantry. This is when I realized maybe I should have refrigerated them I also noticed the lid of the jar was bulging out so I knew it had some pressure built up inside. I'm guessing they started to ferment. I didn't want to open it up right away so I thought I would relive the pressure before opening to throw them away. I took a thumbtack and poked a hole in the lid of the jar. As soon as I took the tack out a geyser of shit smelling bean water shot up to my ceiling. This was the most foul smelling thing I have ever smelled and it covered my kitchen with this rancid bean juice.

I was gone for maximum 30 seconds but when I got back she was not there. At this point I had not realised that my phone was gone, so I went into the garden to check what she was doing. To my horror she had it in her mouth and was throwing it around in the garden. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to chase after her, which of course made her run off with the phone thinking we were playing a game. Only then I thought to tell her to drop it - at which point she happened to be stood right in front of a pile of her own excrement. You can guess what happened next. She then decided to stand on it, smearing shit all over the screen. As I picked it up she gave me a look that I can only describe as a 'fuck you,' and I proceeded to spend a very long time scraping droppings off my phone.\"},\n    {\"title\": \"The freaking fire alarm\", \"trigger\": \"Rundown\", \"day\": \"09-16-2021\", \"story\": \"I’m a senior in college and live with 2 other girls in a student only apartment off campus. For whatever reason I never outgrew wetting the bed and do it almost every night. Up until today I’ve done a pretty good job at hiding it. I change into a diaper at night in my own room and in the morning I stash the used diaper in a large bag I and throw it out in the apartment complex dumpster on my way out. No one other than my ex boyfriend has ever found out about my issues. I live in a hot state and it gets warm at night, no one sees me so I wore these little booty shorts and a tank top to bed. Then, at 3:00 am the fire alarm goes off. I wake up groggy and hear people evacuating the building, and me and my roommates start to head outside too. It’s not until I’m almost out the door that I realize what I’m wearing. Keep in mind, these are not Depend that advertise how discreet they are under yoga pants. These are made for bedwetting. They’re geriatric, tape-on incredibly thick and high waisted diapers, and not to be gross but it was wet too which makes it thicker.

I tried to yank my tank top down as far as I could, but it still didn’t meet the waistband of my shorts. I thought if I didn’t draw attention to it, maybe no one would notice. That is until I heard a guy in a group of about 10 people behind me whisper “I think that chicks wearing a diaper” a couple of people did a light gasp and giggle and I heard one girl say “oh my god, not so loud, she must be so embarrassed.” I turned around instinctively at the group and one girl said to me “cute shorts” and a couple more of them giggled. I was beyond humiliated and turned bright red. That’s when my roommates both looked down and saw the mess that was my lower half. One of them went silent and her eyes went as wide as saucers. My other roommate took off her robe (she was also wearing pajamas) and handed it to me and said “here you look really cold.” I then put on the robe and waited what seemed like an eternity until they let us in the building. As I was walking upstairs I heard someone below us in that same group ask “so was that girl seriously wearing a diaper” and someone responded “yeah I think she was.

For some context I am a 20 y/o male college student and I was working a summer job which is where I met this girl. She had been working there for about 2 years with me but it wasn't until this past summer we really started to make a connection. Most of our interactions while working or on break were always great and we seemed to have a certain sort of chemistry. Then in the latter half of summer she left that job to go somewhere more related to her field of study. Before she did however, she gave me her snap so we could keep in touch which we did. For a while after she left we snapped often, mostly chatting and small talk. On more than one occasion she invited me to come over her house to hang out (she lived with her family still). Sometimes I had other prior commitments so I couldn't make it but other times I just felt too nervous about going over her house by myself that I made up excuses and stayed home. At one point she literally hit me with the ‘my parents aren't home’ bit and I completely brushed it off and claimed I had ‘something else to go to’. Anyway, we start approaching the start of school and I head back to college, but we still have been chatting in the time being. Once the first week of classes hit however, she just stopped responding to my messages.

As a joke, I flopped on the hood of car belly first, my feet pointing away from the school. She hit the gas and off we went. We traveled about 25 yards and I adjusted myself. She thought I was sliding off and hit the brakes. Well, she has hit them a little too hard and slid. I tried to catch myself on the top edge of the hood but missed and snagged her windshield wiper which didn't hold. So I slid off and my feet hit first. Now, I'm a fairly large guy about 200 lbs. That's alot of weight to get stopped quickly. My ankles were simply not hoss enough to handle it. My feet hit the ground and I thought I heard my boots scrape the ground, in hindsight I think it was my ankles. The area around my ankles went numb and tingly while simultaneously hurting like hell. I tumbled about 5 times hitting my elbow along the way leaving it nice and bruised. I layed out and all I could do was yell in pain. I had bilateral fractures in both of my ankles. Meaning I broke both bones in each ankle totalling out to four bones broke. According to the doc, that was the second worst type of fracture I could've gotten. I destroyed my left ankle joint with the doc pulling out a lot of bone and cartilage fragments. I'm non weight baring for 8-10 weeks.

Then she asked why I asked. Please keep in mind I was half awake as I was pretty tired. I just responded ‘Just curious, and also since you said you weren’t ready for a relationship so I was thinking I could wait for you to be ready.’ She didn’t reply for a while and 10 minutes later I decided to check our dm and as I was re reading what I sent her, I start realizing what I said was incredibly weird.

For whatever reason I never outgrew wetting the bed and do it almost every night. Up until today I’ve done a pretty good job at hiding it. I change into a diaper at night in my own room and in the morning I stash the used diaper in a large bag I and throw it out in the apartment complex dumpster on my way out. No one other than my ex boyfriend has ever found out about my issues. I live in a hot state and it gets warm at night, no one sees me so I wore these little booty shorts and a tank top to bed. Then, at 3:00 am the fire alarm goes off. I wake up groggy and hear people evacuating the building, and me and my roommates start to head outside too. It’s not until I’m almost out the door that I realize what I’m wearing. Keep in mind, these are not Depend that advertise how discreet they are under yoga pants. These are made for bedwetting. They’re geriatric, tape-on incredibly thick and high waisted diapers, and not to be gross but it was wet too which makes it thicker. The waistband was peeking above my pants and the bulk clearly showed through the thin fabric of my shorts. I tried to yank my tank top down as far as I could, but it still didn’t meet the waistband of my shorts. I thought if I didn’t draw attention to it, maybe no one would notice. That is until I heard a guy in a group of about 10 people behind me whisper “I think that chicks wearing a diaper” a couple of people did a light gasp and giggle and I heard one girl say “oh my god, not so loud, she must be so embarrassed.” I turned around instinctively at the group and one girl said to me “cute shorts” and a couple more of them giggled. I was beyond humiliated and turned bright red. That’s when my roommates both looked down and saw the mess that was my lower half. One of them went silent and her eyes went as wide as saucers. My other roommate took off her robe (she was also wearing pajamas) and handed it to me and said “here you look really cold.” I then put on the robe and waited what seemed like an eternity until they let us in the building. As I was walking upstairs I heard someone below us in that same group ask “so was that girl seriously wearing a diaper” and someone responded “yeah I think she was. This happened a couple days ago and no one has said anything to me sense, but I have never been so embarrassed in my life.\"},\n    {\"title\": \"Scooby Doo\", \"trigger\": \"Ambiguity\", \"day\": \"11-02-2021\", \"story\": \"This wasn't actually today, but I recently got reminded about it so I'm posting it anyways.

I had to visit HR after lunch. I was told my comment wasn’t appreciated and not to do it again.\"},\n  {\"title\": \"I missed my chance\", \"trigger\": \"Fear\", \"day\": \"09-21-2021\", \"story\": \"So this happened this summer but the full realization of what happened didn't hit me until recently. For some context I am a 20 y/o male college student and I was working a summer job which is where I met this girl. She had been working there for about 2 years with me but it wasn't until this past summer we really started to make a connection. Most of our interactions while working or on break were always great and we seemed to have a certain sort of chemistry. Then in the latter half of summer she left that job to go somewhere more related to her field of study. Before she did however, she gave me her snap so we could keep in touch which we did. For a while after she left we snapped often, mostly chatting and small talk. On more than one occasion she invited me to come over her house to hang out (she lived with her family still). Sometimes I had other prior commitments so I couldn't make it but other times I just felt too nervous about going over her house by myself that I made up excuses and stayed home. At one point she literally hit me with the ‘my parents aren't home’ bit and I completely brushed it off and claimed I had ‘something else to go to’. Anyway, we start approaching the start of school and I head back to college, but we still have been chatting in the time being. Once the first week of classes hit however, she just stopped responding to my messages. I figured she was busy with classes but after a while (several weeks) of me sending the occasional snap or ‘hey’ with no response I realized she had most likely ghosted me. I didn't grasp the severity of how bad I screwed up until I recently had a 2 am realization like we all do.\"},\n  {\"title\": \"Thought I was a teenager\", \"trigger\": \"Fear\", \"day\": \"10-14-2021\", \"story\": \"It was a normal day at school and the bell to get to class had rung. I was walking back up the school from my truck. It's only about 100 yards or so. As I'm nearing the school my friend rolls up in her mini van and stops to give me the bird. As friends do. As a joke, I flopped on the hood of car belly first, my feet pointing away from the school. She hit the gas and off we went. We traveled about 25 yards and I adjusted myself. She thought I was sliding off and hit the brakes. Well, she has hit them a little too hard and slid. I tried to catch myself on the top edge of the hood but missed and snagged her windshield wiper which didn't hold. So I slid off and my feet hit first. Now, I'm a fairly large guy about 200 lbs. That's alot of weight to get stopped quickly. My ankles were simply not hoss enough to handle it. My feet hit the ground and I thought I heard my boots scrape the ground, in hindsight I think it was my ankles. The area around my ankles went numb and tingly while simultaneously hurting like hell. I tumbled about 5 times hitting my elbow along the way leaving it nice and bruised. I layed out and all I could do was yell in pain. I had bilateral fractures in both of my ankles. Meaning I broke both bones in each ankle totalling out to four bones broke. According to the doc, that was the second worst type of fracture I could've gotten. I destroyed my left ankle joint with the doc pulling out a lot of bone and cartilage fragments. I'm non weight baring for 8-10 weeks. The 8 weeks mark being new years eve.\"},\n  {\"title\": \"My Crush is Cringe\", \"trigger\": \"Fear\", \"day\": \"10-30-2021\", \"story\": \"So this just happened an hour ago and I wanna drown myself. I (15M) had a crush in this girl we’ll call Rose. Recently I finally had the courage to confess to her how I felt and we fortunately ended things on a good note with her saying she’s not ready for a relationship and remained good friends. Things should’ve ended there right? But my stupid self decided no. Jump to today; I was working on my homework while talking to Rose. We were running out of topics to talk about, and I decided to ask ‘When do you think you’re ready for a relationship?’ She just replied she couldn’t imagine herself being in a relationship. Then she asked why I asked. Please keep in mind I was half awake as I was pretty tired. I just responded ‘Just curious, and also since you said you weren’t ready for a relationship so I was thinking I could wait for you to be ready.’ She didn’t reply for a while and 10 minutes later I decided to check our dm and as I was re reading what I sent her, I start realizing what I said was incredibly weird. I decided to delete the message and changed my reply to ‘Donno just curious’ Since discord is an asshole, they don’t show if the other person had read the message or not. So I was hoping she didn’t see it, but I knew I was too far late. I told our mutual friend about it and they said she read it. My. Heart. Stopped. I just wanted to die.. I probably made things worse for us and she wasn’t going to see me the same way ever again. I’ve been typing this out and thinking what I should do. She did reply to me like she didn’t see what happened.. so now im fully awake.. not sure what to do.. I’ll keep you guys updated if anything happens if ya’ll interested Anyways thanks for reading.\"}\n])\n  const [goalsRecords, setGoalsRecords] = useState([\n  {\"title\": \"Diffusing with Humor Fail\", \"trigger\": \"Goals\", \"day\": \"10-13-2021\", \"story\": \"Long story short, my dumbass self thought it would be a great idea to be the funny guy and deliberately put a slightly offensive joke in an oral case study presented to the dean.

He has a set of keys we need to use to walk him and if we don’t walk him we get in big trouble with the parents. While normally he only had one walk, today he had two. My shift ended before the second walk so another person was going to do it until they noticed they were missing the keys and texted me. My friend and I had been planning going to a Korean bbq place that has a 30 minute time limit for a while now and I got the text from work 5 minutes after we started eating. The place cost 40 dollars per person plus additional beverages and tip so if I left then I wouldn’t be able to make it in time back as I would be using public transport. It’s also the first time I’ve seen my friend in a month and a half. After a back and forth with my manager and another coworker I thought I would be able to drop it off later on as the coworker told me this but then I got called by my boss who then ordered an Uber so that I could send back the key in my bag despite me saying I could leave immediately. I feel terrible and although I was told that mistakes happen by my boss, the manager did not respond to my further messages so now I believe she highly dislikes me. I was told by someone else that I am already disliked for being picky or bossy so now I’m sure that there is not a single person at work that doesn’t dislike me. I’m also scared for the sanctity of my job.\"},\n  {\"title\": \"Diffusing with Humor Fail\", \"trigger\": \"Goals\", \"day\": \"10-13-2021\", \"story\": \"Long story short, my dumbass self thought it would be a great idea to be the funny guy and deliberately put a slightly offensive joke in an oral case study presented to the dean.

We showed them some of the unique things about Texas eg bbq, bucees, etc. Anyway while they were here we started talking about eating different things from different countries and she asks if I have ever eaten bugs. I have but only once but I’m open to try anything once. Fast forward to this morning. I’m laying in bed and my wife goes to get the mail. She hands me a padded envelope and says it’s from (friend). No idea what it could be so I tear open the package. Our dog was very interested btw. I get a smell like nuts so I’m thinking ‘strange she would send me nuts’ when a few fall out onto my shirtless torso and on the bed. They’re very black and now I’m more confused. Then I focus on one and I realize it’s a cricket body. She sent me fried crickets. One of the bags must have broken open in transit so they’re falling all over the place and my wife is losing her SHIT screaming about bugs in the bed.
